You are provided with a schema file schema.sql and two seed files players.sql, teams.sql that are also in the nfl_seed_data folder. Create a new database called nfl and use the schema and seed file to populate your database.

Record your answers to Step 3 in a file called nfl.sql.

Challenge: Complete each part with a single SQL expression. That is possible, but for some queries, it will involve learning how to use compound SQL expressions.

# Queries
